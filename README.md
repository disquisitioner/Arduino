Arduino
===============

I think the two things I most appreciate about the Arduino platform are the ease of experimenting with all manner of hardware components, and the incredibly rich collection of great work other people have done and freely contributed back to the community.  Want to experiment with sensors? Batteries? Seven-segment display? Robots? No problem!  Curious about programming with interrupts?  Motor control?  Audio?  Most likely all the components you need and great examples of how to get started are an easy web search away.

So here is both the accumulation of my own experimentation, and my modest contribution back to the community.  Much of what I've done has yet to leave my workbench, but a few creations have made it out into the real world.  You'll find both specific individual projects (like my home weather station) and  collections of programs that have resulted from experimenting with hardware components that struck my fancy (like controllable LED strips & matrices).

**Intervalometer**

This is the project that attracted me to Arduino in the first place.  I wanted to try my hand at time lapse photography but couldn't understand why I needed to buy an expensive camera controller (called an 'Intervalometer') when it was little more than some simple timing calculations and a switch to trigger the remote control of my digital SLR.

**Weather Station**

This is my second major Arduino project, though the first one to get put into everyday use.  For years my wife and I had thought about buying and installing a home weather station but somehow never got around to doing it.  It didn't take me long to realize I could easily build my own and have a lot more fun in the process.  An Arduino manages several  weather-related sensors, reading and processing their data to generate a set of readings which can be displayed directly and also relayed to a home computer (or similar device) for logging, daily report generation, etc.

**OLED Name Badge**

Motivated by the "build your own name tag" activity at the Make Hardware Innovation Workshop, I decided to craft something a little less spontaneous but more elaborate. Imagine the traditional "Hello, My Name Is..." badge redone on a comparably-sized circuit board using an Arduino, OLED display, and lithium-polymer battery.

**Hexbright**

I love flashlights so was excited (delighted, even) to discover 'Hexbright', a very bright, well-made, compact LED flashlight that had an Arduino and some sensors on board and could be programmed to behave however you wanted it to.
So far I've only made a few simple modifications to the factory-installed program, but I've also had fun trying some
of the novel variations developed by other folks in the Hexbright community.

**Thermometers**

As a precursor to my weather station project I spent time experimenting with various temperature sensors, and with 
different ways to display temperature information.  Even a basic thermometer is useful, and so this has come to
be my standard Arduino demo program (even moreso than blinking an LED).

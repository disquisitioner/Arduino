Weather Station PCB
===============

This collection of Arduino sketches helped me incrementally build and verify the custom printed circuit board I designed for my home weather station (specifically the
'Weather Station Plus' version).  As it was my first custom PCB I wasn't sure I had properly handled all the critical aspects of PCB design that I knew could
cause problems -- routing, interference, improper connections, etc. I therefore wanted to be able to systematically add each component to the PCB and test that
single addition to make sure everything worked, or if not at what point I added something that caused the whole board to not work properly.

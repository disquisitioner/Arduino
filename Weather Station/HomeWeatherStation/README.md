Home Weather Station
===============

At last, a complete version of my home weather station software supporting
the full set of sensors I was interested in and ready to be paired with a
custom printed circuit board designed for all the electronics. This version
includes transitioning from the BMP085 temperature/pressure sensor, which
had been retired in favor of a newer BMP180 version.
